# Text-to-BPMN 2.0 Node.js Project

**Text-to-BPMN 2.0** is a web-based tool that allows users to generate executable BPMN 2.0 process diagrams from natural language descriptions. By leveraging powerful large language models such as DeepSeek and OpenAI, the application transforms informal text into well-structured BPMN XML, which can be visualized, validated, and edited directly in the browser. It is designed to lower the technical barrier of process modeling and support business analysts, developers, and non-technical users alike in capturing workflows quickly and intuitively.

Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and the **bpmn-js** toolkit, this project integrates API-based language model inference with client-side BPMN rendering and semantic validation.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone or download this project folder

```bash
cd text-to-bpmn2.0
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build the frontend

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Create `.env` file

At the root level, create a `.env` file with:

```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-deepseek-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-chatgpt-api-key-here
```

Replace with your real DeepSeek API key.

### 4. Start the server

```bash
npm start
```

Visit:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

✅ Text-to-BPMN2.0 app will be live on your local machine.
